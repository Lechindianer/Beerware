You know the situation: You're in a bar/disco you don't visit so frequently,
order a beer but... OH NOOO! What a horrible taste!  Then you remember... 
Oh, I had this beer already the last time, but didn't remember that I 
disliked it also the last time.

Beerware will make you remember. You can save and rate beers and view a
sorted list of your tried beers.
