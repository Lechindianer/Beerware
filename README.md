## Update

This project isn't updated anymore. My Jolla died :( Please check out [Petr's fork](https://github.com/mentaljam/Beerware) instead

You know the situation: You're in a bar/disco (that) you don't visit frequently.
You order a beer but... oh no! What a horrible taste!  Then you remember: you 
ordered this beer last time --- you just didn't remember that you disliked it.

Beerware will make you remember. You can save and rate beers and view a
sorted list of your tried beers.

The beer icon is by [aungkarns](https://openclipart.org/detail/73591/beer)

## ATTENTION
This code could eat your cat, burn your house or some other catasthrophy. Use with care!
